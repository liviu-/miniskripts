"""
I noticed that sometimes I end up with some seemingly empty lines that have
a bunch of whitespace fitting the indentation of the line above. Haven't yet identified what sorts of flaw in my workflow leads me to these, but they're
particularly noticeable when I try to navigate the file by paragraphs i.e.
('{' and '}' are the default bindings) which care about the non-empty-line.

# Vim:
:%s/\s\+$//g  # Also removes trailing whitespace

# Sed:
sed 's/\s\+$//' file  # Also removes trailing whitespace

# Awk:
awk '!/^\s+$/{print;next}/^\s+$/{print "\n"}' file
